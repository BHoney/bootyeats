# BootyEats

## A Python Bot By BloodyHoney

Hello, this is a very stupid little project I created called Booty Eats and I'm very sorry that you found it. Thanks for stopping by.

[Booty Eats](twitter.com/bootyeats_bot) is a recipe bot for twitter writen to automatically tweet "Eat the Booty Like..." followed by a randomized recipe found using the Food2Fork API, with an accompanying link and image.

It originally started as a way for me to automatically make jokes about analingus and turned into something that might be useful. Again, I'm sorry. Please forgive me. This joke isn't even good.

In the end this was a test run for further Python practices using Python 2.7 and Heroku. I hope you enjoy the bot and make something delicious using it. Send me pictures by @ing the bot directly.
